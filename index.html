  <h2>About &#187; </h2>
  <p>In the Fall I am attending College at Full Sail University to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Game Design.  I want to pursue a job that I can be happy to go to every day. I enjoy working on computers since it's always been fun and easy for me, and video games are my favorite hobby.  I would love to have a career that merges the two.  Whenever I play video games I look at the details and consider the amount of design creators put into it.  I understand the technology field requires a lot of hard work and continuous learning, but I am determined and motivated to do what it takes.</p>
