  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>What i wanna do after i finish high school is that i would want to attend college after school during the fall so that i can aim to be
    a video game designer. I've always been told to pursue a job that i can be happy to go in everyday and enjoy everything i can learn or 
    even teach from the career. After much thinking i always did enjoy working on computers since it's always been fun and easy for me, but
    also playing video games have always been a hobby of mine and would love to have a career based on the two. Whenever i play video games
    looking at the details and all the design that the creators put into making the game have always interest me and would love to see the
    day where i can start creating video games so that other people can really enjoy and possibly even inspire other people to become video
    game designers based on work i manage to accomplish. When i realized that i wanted to become a video game designer i did some research 
    on which school i should attened and saw that full were one of the best school to attend for anyone who would want to become a video 
    game designer, i would want to try and attend full sail to earn at least a bachelor degree in Game design. It all might seem like it's
    hard work but i am still determine to at least try to aim for that career no matter what people say so that i can live a happy and 
    fulfilling life as a really good video game designer that have extended knowledge on the basic of making a video game to impress 
    everyone with that ability.</p>
